\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

This sections provides a detailed overview of the validation and verification of the system, including specific validation and verification roles, requirements verification, and design verification.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ibrahim Quraishi}: Backend Tester. Verifies that the backend service logic complies with all related functional requirements as well as nonfunctional requirements such as performance and maintainability requirements.
  \item \textbf{Omar Al-Asfar}: Mobile Application Tester. Verifies the mobile application complies with all related functional requirements as well as nonfunctional requirements such as usability and look and feel requirements.
  \item \textbf{Rayyan Suhail}: Web Application Tester. Verifies the admin web application complies with all related functional requirements as well as nonfunctional requirements such as usability and look and feel requirements. 
  \item \textbf{Virochaan Ravichandran Gowri}: Integration Tester. Tests the overall integration of system components and their compliance with non-functional requirements such as performance and maintainability.
  \item \textbf{Mohammad Mahdi Mahboob}: Security Tester. Tests the security of the system by checking for compliance with security standards and legal requirements.
  \item \textbf{Luke Schermann}: Supervisor and Acceptance Tester. Supervises the overal implementation of the system, ensuring stakeholder requirements are met. Responsible for attending acceptance testing workshops with the developers for the admin web portal.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SRS Verification}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\subsubsection{Requirements Validation}
The first step of verification for the software requirements specification is to design and implement a suite of tests that provide a comprehensive coverage of the functional and non functional requirements. To ensure traceability between test cases and requirements, each test case should maintain a clear documentation referencing which requirements it covers, its inputs, and expected behaviour. The requirements validation will be split into two parts. 

\textbf{Component Level}
Each of the main components of the system listed below will first be tested in isolation without connections to other components. Wherever necessary, dummy data will be used to fill in inputs or outputs from other system components.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Web Admin Application:} Testing of UI elements, event and survey creation, form module creation, and analytics viewing. May use a combination of React Testing Library and Jest.
  \item \textbf{Mobile Attendee Application:} Testing of UI elements, event registration, survey completion, response editing. May use a combination of React Testing Library and Jest.
  \item \textbf{Backend Server:} Testing of data, security and encryption, server capacity limits, and API responses. This will also include testing and performance measurements of database querying and posting. Testing framework(s) will depend on language used to build the backend. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{System Level}
  After integration of each of the system's components are complete, additional system level testing will be done to verify end to end behaviour. The system will be deployed to a staging environment to carry out automated testing using a framework such as Selenium/Appium as well as manual testing from the frontend sides by developers. This will include testing of non functional requirements which can only be done on the entire system such as speed, latency, and capacity requirements.

\subsubsection{Stakeholder Review}
  While regular weekly update meetings and/or feature demonstrations will occur with our supervisor, Luke Schermann, an additional formal stakeholder review will be conducted with Luke and any other MES executives who are interested in attending. Assuming the supervisor has read through the SRS, a comprehensive walkthrough of the entire system will be presented, including a summary of key requirements and conduct end to end demonstrations of system workflows with a focus on the administrative user perspective. The purpose of the review is to confirm that the system meets all requirements specified by the stakeholders and provide an opportunity to gather feedback on the completed system to address any outstanding concerns before the final deployment. A list of specific feedback questions will be prepared for the meeting, such as questions on project scoping, additional constraints, and whether project goals have been met.
  
  \subsubsection{User Acceptance Testing}
  User acceptance testing will be conducted on a staging deployment of the system with a group of about 10 test users. Each user will be given a list of actions to perform on the attendee mobile application without help from developers, such as looking up and registering for an evert or filling out a survey. The user will then provide feedback on the experience of completing these actions which will be analyzed for final improvments before the initial launch.

\subsubsection{Pilot Launch}
  By request of the project supervisor, a pilot program of the system will be launched in January. This pilot program will involve testing the system in a scenario with real users, such as the Fireball Formal and CFES National Survey. The system will be deployed to a production environment, where users will use the application as intended. Feedback will be collected by attendees and admins as well as feedback from the supervisor on user satisfaction. to analyze and address any final problems before the official launch of the system.

\subsection{Design Verification}

The design verification of the system will involve verifying that the proposed system architecture and detailed design satisfy all requirements outlined in the SRS. Design verifications will be conducted by the supervisor, Luke Schermann, as well as through peer reviews. The process will ensuring the design's goals are achievable within the given time frame and that there are no inconsistencies or conflicts between design decision.

For peer reviews, design documents such as architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, and entity-relationship models will be reviewed for feasibility, unambiguity, clarity, and  consistency with requirements specified in the SRS. Reviewers will also have the chance to provide feedback on the design to identify potential design flaws. Peer feedback will be tracked using GitHub Issues and implemented before the formal design review with the supervisor.

For the formal design review, the supervisor will be presented with a detailed walkthrough of the system architecture and rationale for key design decisions. This presentation will cover the entire system architecure with an emphasis on the admin perspective of system. The supervisor will provide feedback and propose changes to ensure the design aligns with the interest of major stakeholders.

\label{tab:design_verification_checklist}
\end{longtable}


\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification}

To verify the verification and validation strategies presented in this document, a series of peer reviews and internal reviews will be done. Before peer reviews, developers will review the completed document by reviewing sections written by other developers and compare the content with their own contributions to the document. This will ensure there are no inconsistencies between sections such as inconstent language or conflicting test case definitions. The peer review will be conducted by members of another team, who will conduct a review given a coverage checklist derived from the requirements in SRS to ensure the proposed plan provides complete coverage of all outlined requirements.
\\
Addionally, several mutation tests must be done for every system test and unit test outlined in this document to ensure robustness of the proposed test suite on each of the systems components.

\textbf{Internal Developer Review} &
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cross-check sections written by other developers for consistency
  \item Verify that all test case definitions align with corresponding requirements
  \item Ensure there are no conflicting assumptions between sections
\end{itemize}
\\
\hline

\textbf{Peer Team Review} &
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a coverage checklist derived from SRS requirements to confirm all requirements are tested
  \item Identify any missing or ambiguous verification strategies
  \item Provide feedback to improve clarity and completeness of the plan on GitHub Issues
  \item Perform feedback actions
\end{itemize}
\\
\hline

\textbf{Mutation Testing Validation} &
\begin{itemize}
  \item Conduct mutation tests for all unit and system tests to evaluate robustness
  \item Ensure that all mutations are detected or properly justified if surviving
  \item Document weak or incomplete test cases as GitHub Issues
  \item Update unit and system test specification
\end{itemize}
\\

\label{tab:vnv_plan_checklist}
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Implementation Verification}

To make sure that the system works as intended and meets all the goals set out in the SRS, our team will verify the implementation through both testing and review processes. The focus will mainly be on the four main parts: the \textbf{Custom Form Builder}, \textbf{Registration and Feedback Forms}, \textbf{Attendee Overview}, and \textbf{Backend Analytics}. 

\subsubsection*{Dynamic Verification}
Dynamic verification will confirm that each feature works correctly through practical testing during development.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Unit Testing:} Every module will be tested on its own using Jest and the React Testing Library. These tests will check things like whether form fields are created properly, if branching logic behaves as expected, and whether data is saved correctly in the database. 
  \item \textbf{Integration Testing:} Once the individual parts are stable, integration tests will be done to make sure the frontend and backend communicate properly. These tests will confirm that data moves smoothly between the admin portal, the backend server, and the shared database used by the other capstone teams.
  \item \textbf{System and Acceptance Testing:} The final round of testing will simulate real MES events, such as the Fireball Formal or CALE Conference. This will test the full flow—from creating a form, registering attendees, collecting feedback, and generating analytics. We will also check that pages load quickly (forms within about two seconds and analytics within about four) and that all security and accessibility requirements are met. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Static Verification}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Code Reviews and Walkthroughs:} Every major change will go through a peer review before being merged. The team will check that the code and the logic matches what’s described in the SRS.
  \item \textbf{Static Analysis Tools:} Automatic tools like ESLint and Prettier will be used through GitHub Actions to keep formatting consistent and catch syntax or logic mistakes. We’ll also run scans to identify any issues in third-party libraries (for example, \texttt{npm audit}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Usability Verification}
As part of the final CAS 741 presentation, we will also conduct a short usability check. MES members and students will try out basic workflows such as creating a form, signing up for an event, or checking analytics. Their feedback on how easy or confusing it feels will help us fine-tune the interface before final deployment.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation}

\subsubsection*{Stakeholder Review and Demonstrations}
Validation will occur continuously through review sessions with the project supervisor, Luke Schuurman. Each major milestone will be demonstrated to him for feedback to ensure that the system aligns with MES needs. The \textbf{Rev 0 demonstration} will serve as the first major validation checkpoint, where core workflows—form creation, registration, feedback submission, and analytics—will be shown to the supervisor for approval. 

After the scheduled Rev 0 demo, the team will conduct a dedicated review meeting with the supervisor to gather specific feedback on usability, workflow logic, and data visualization accuracy. This feedback will guide refinements for later iterations and integration with other teams’ modules.

\subsubsection*{Task-Based User Testing}
Toward the end of the development cycle, we plan to conduct task-based inspections where selected MES members and student users will complete typical actions such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Creating a registration or feedback form
  \item Submitting a form as an attendee
  \item Viewing analytics in the admin dashboard
\end{itemize}
Their success rate and feedback will help validate that the system is intuitive and easy to use without any formal training.

\subsubsection*{External Data for Validation}
There are no external data sets required for validation since this is a new system replacing manual workflows. However, data collected from real events (e.g., Fireball Formal or CALE Conference) will later be compared with historical Google Form data to confirm that the new system provides the same or improved accuracy and completeness of records.

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
