\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

The following core features of the product will be tested:

\begin{description}
  \item[Custom Form Builder] Allows admins to create and publish survey forms; obtains responses from attendees; and
    allows admins to view responses.
  \item[Registration and Feedback Forms] Allow admins to create or monitor registration forms for events; allow students
    to register for events; generate QR codes and tickets for students to confirm their registrations; receive feedback
    from students regarding events; allow admins to review feedback received from students.
  \item[Attendee Overview] Allow admins to view event attendance; allow admins to update event statuses and inform
    attendees of changes; allow attendees to receive notifications regarding events.
  \item[Backend Analytics] Allow admins to query any set of form questions and view aggregated results from the query;
    allow admins to freely visualize relevant data points from surveys; allow admins to export analytics data as
    SCV/Excel reports.
\end{description}

\noindent The testing ranges from individual unit testing to overall system integration testing to ensure that all functionality
works as intended.
\subsection{Objectives}

The purpose of this verification and validation plan is to evaluate the reliability, accuracy, and conformity of the
\teamname~with its requirements. The main objectives are to build confidence in the correctness of the overall system,
verify that all core features and functionality operate as intended, and demonstrate that the system will perform well
when deployed by MES. The testing focus will be on ensuring functionality, performance, reliability, and correctness of
the core components, both in isolation and when integrated with the rest of the system. These core components are
essential to the completion of the capstone, so they must function correctly in order to meet the project goals.

User Interface and application usability are out of scope for the testing roadmap outlined in this plan as they are
addressed in the project extras. Also out of scope for this plan is verification of external libraries and third-party
tools (such as PostgreSQL and React) as it is assumed that these products have been validated by their respective
developers. This plan prioritizes the testing and verification of the team's bespoke components and their integration
with the overall system.

\subsection{Extras}

\subsubsection{Usability Report}
The usability report will evaluate the overall ease-of-use of the application for both admins and attendees. This
includes definition of evaluation metrics, description of the evaluation process, evaluation results, and an analysis of
the data gathered from the evaluation to determine the usability of the application based on its conformity to the
outlined metrics.

\subsubsection{Wireframe Report}
The wireframe report will document the design process for the application user interface for both admins and attendees.
It will justify design decisions and how the team expects these visual representations to allow users to navigate the
application with a reasonably low amount of effort.


\subsection{Relevant Documentation}
The following documents are relevant to the context of the verification and validation plan:
\begin{enumerate}[align=left,
  leftmargin=*,
  labelsep=1em,
  itemindent=0em, font=\bfseries]
  \item {\bfseries SRS:} Defines all functional and non-functional requirements which form the basis of the verification
    process \citep{SRS}.
  \item {\bfseries Development Plan:} Outlines the code and development structure as well as lists third-party
    technologies which will be used for development, and defines the technology to be used for testing \citep{DVP}.
  \item {\bfseries Usability Report:} Provides a thorough evaluation of the application and user interface for design
    validation.
  \item {\bfseries Wireframe Report:} Documents the user interface design process, including mockups from which design
    evaluations may stem.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}


\subsection{Implementation Verification}

To make sure that the system works as intended and meets all the goals set out in the SRS, our team will verify the implementation through both testing and review processes. The focus will mainly be on the four main parts: the \textbf{Custom Form Builder}, \textbf{Registration and Feedback Forms}, \textbf{Attendee Overview}, and \textbf{Backend Analytics}.

\subsubsection*{Dynamic Verification}
Dynamic verification will confirm that each feature works correctly through practical testing during development.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Unit Testing:} Every module will be tested on its own using Jest and the React Testing Library. These tests will check things like whether form fields are created properly, if branching logic behaves as expected, and whether data is saved correctly in the database.
  \item \textbf{Integration Testing:} Once the individual parts are stable, integration tests will be done to make sure the frontend and backend communicate properly. These tests will confirm that data moves smoothly between the admin portal, the backend server, and the shared database used by the other capstone teams.
  \item \textbf{System and Acceptance Testing:} The final round of testing will simulate real MES events, such as the Fireball Formal or CALE Conference. This will test the full flow—from creating a form, registering attendees, collecting feedback, and generating analytics. We will also check that pages load quickly (forms within about two seconds and analytics within about four) and that all security and accessibility requirements are met.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Static Verification}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Code Reviews and Walkthroughs:} Every major change will go through a peer review before being merged. The team will check that the code and the logic matches what’s described in the SRS.
  \item \textbf{Static Analysis Tools:} Automatic tools like ESLint and Prettier will be used through GitHub Actions to keep formatting consistent and catch syntax or logic mistakes. We’ll also run scans to identify any issues in third-party libraries (for example, \texttt{npm audit}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Usability Verification}
As part of the final CAS 741 presentation, we will also conduct a short usability check. MES members and students will try out basic workflows such as creating a form, signing up for an event, or checking analytics. Their feedback on how easy or confusing it feels will help us fine-tune the interface before final deployment.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation}

\subsubsection*{Stakeholder Review and Demonstrations}
Validation will occur continuously through review sessions with the project supervisor, Luke Schuurman. Each major milestone will be demonstrated to him for feedback to ensure that the system aligns with MES needs. The \textbf{Rev 0 demonstration} will serve as the first major validation checkpoint, where core workflows—form creation, registration, feedback submission, and analytics—will be shown to the supervisor for approval.

After the scheduled Rev 0 demo, the team will conduct a dedicated review meeting with the supervisor to gather specific feedback on usability, workflow logic, and data visualization accuracy. This feedback will guide refinements for later iterations and integration with other teams’ modules.

\subsubsection*{Task-Based User Testing}
Toward the end of the development cycle, we plan to conduct task-based inspections where selected MES members and student users will complete typical actions such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Creating a registration or feedback form
  \item Submitting a form as an attendee
  \item Viewing analytics in the admin dashboard
\end{itemize}
Their success rate and feedback will help validate that the system is intuitive and easy to use without any formal training.

\subsubsection*{External Data for Validation}
There are no external data sets required for validation since this is a new system replacing manual workflows. However, data collected from real events (e.g., Fireball Formal or CALE Conference) will later be compared with historical Google Form data to confirm that the new system provides the same or improved accuracy and completeness of records.

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}

Initial State:

Input:

Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed:

\subsubsection{Module 2}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
