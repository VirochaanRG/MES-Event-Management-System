\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acUI}:] 
  The user interface of the app. Modifications may be made to improve usability, accessibility, or better represent the use case (eg. MES).
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acForms}:] 
  The form builder functionality. The structure and logic of registration and feedback forms may change to support new fields, features, or requirements.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acAuth}:] 
  The user authentication and authorization policy. The security and user requirements may evolve, requiring the introduction of new authentication techniques (eg. custom login, university single sign-on). There may also be a need to add new user/admin roles, or modify the permissions process based on the use case.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acData}:] 
  Backend functionality. The database handling or entry relationships may change to support scalability, or custom event workflows.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acNotifications}:] 
  Notification delivery methods. Communication channels (email, SMS, push notifications) and message formats may improve to meet updated communication needs for event reminders, updates, or confirmations.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acSecurity}:] 
  Security and encryption network. The app's security standards may require updated encryption algorithms, expanded input validation, and refined logging detail depending on the use case to ensure compliance.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acIntegration}:] 
  External integration methods. The app may be required to connect with specialized APIs, external databases, or other third-party systems (eg. payment gateways). The data formats and protocols used in these integrations may evolve over time.
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucUse}:] 
  Changes to the primary application of events, registration, tickets, and feedback. The development is focused solely on event management and is not expected to change to accomodate other uses.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucStack}:] 
  Migrating to a different technology stack. The current architecture is designed around an existing framework. A different technology stack would require reimplementing nearly all modules.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucData}:] 
  Transitioning from a centralized database model. The platform relies on centralized data storage for all event management, and applies role-based access to ensure users are only viewing permitted information. Moving to a different model (eg. decentralized) would conflict with the functional requirements, and require rethinking the entire user interaction model.
\end{description}


\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Tables~\ref{TblRT} to~\ref{TblRT_Compliance}.


\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

% \wss{The uses relation is not a data flow diagram.  In the code there will often
% be an import statement in module A when it directly uses module B.  Module B
% provides the services that module A needs.  The code for module A needs to be
% able to see these services (hence the import statement).  Since the uses
% relation is transitive, there is a use relation without an import, but the
% arrows in the diagram typically correspond to the presence of import statement.}

% \wss{If module A uses module B, the arrow is directed from A to B.}

\section{User Interfaces}

The platform offers a web application with supporting two distinct user views, general users and administrators. 

\subsection{User Interface}

Initially, users are presented with a sign-up/log-in Authentication screen (Figure~\ref{Fig2}). Upon authentication, users are taken to a Homepage that serves as the foundation of the user app (Figure~\ref{Fig3}). From this page, users can access the Events and Surveys sections through clearly labeled tabs, as well as profile information and the logout option.

The Events page displays a list of all available events (Figure~\ref{Fig4}), each of which can be expanded to reveal detailed event information such as date, location, and description (Figure~\ref{Fig5}). Users may register for an event directly from this page, after which the event would appear in the Registered Events tab (Figure~\ref{Fig6}). In this tab, users can select registered events to view the generated QR code ticket for event check-in (Figure~\ref{Fig7}).

The Surveys page operates with a similar structure. Available surveys are listed and can be selected to open a survey completion interface (Figure~\ref{Fig8}). Surveys consist of various question types presented sequentially, including multiple choice, short answer, and scale ratings (Figure~\ref{Fig9}). After submission, completed surveys are moved to the Completed Surveys tab, where users can review surveys they have already filled out (Figure~\ref{Fig10}).

\subsection{Admin Interface}

Administrators access a separate interface designed for event and survey management. They start with a similar sign-up/log-in authentication process (Figure~\ref{Fig11}). This sends the user to the Admin Dashboard which allows for navigation between different tab (Figure~\ref{Fig12}).

The Events page, admin can view all existing events with key details, and create new ones. Clicking on existing events opens a page listing all registered users (Figure~\ref{Fig13}). Admin can also create events from the dashboard, opening a modal requesting event details such as name, time, capacity, and description (Figure~\ref{Fig14}). Upon submission, the event becomes immediately available to users in the aforementioned user Available Events Page.

Admin can also use the Form Builder to create and manage surveys (Figure~\ref{Fig15}). When creating a survey, admin can add questions and customize surveys by selecting from the different supported question types (Figure~\ref{Fig16}). Completed surveys appear in the Available Surveys user list. Finally, Form Analytics allows admin to observe data and survey metrics, such as number of submissions, and response statistics. This data can be exported to a .csv file through the interactive button (Figure~\ref{Fig17}).

\section{Design of Communication Protocols}
No relevant communication protocols are neccesary for this project.

\section{Timeline}
The timeline shows the development of our platform from december after our POC. It describes the deadlines for implementation of the modules and who will be taking ownership of the module. Some modules may have to be updated based on implementations of other modules but this deadline represents implementation of base feature set.

\subsubsection*{Week 1 (December 1 - 7):} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item M1 - Main System Module (Ibrahim): Set up the basic framework of the application with the various servers and portals for admin and users. Define interface and connection with other modules.
  \item M12 - Database Access Module (Virochaan): Set up the Database to work with the Main Application. Create various schema relating to the different stored data in the database.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Week 2 (December 8 - 14):} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item M2 - User Authentication Module(Mohammad): Set up basic user authentication with the server. Ensure only allowed accounts can sign up and enter the platform. Create various test accounts for development and testing.
