\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

The proposed platform will be utilized by the McMaster Engineering Society (MES)
as a centralized event management system and survey feedback collection system.
The system boundary includes all the functionality required to build and render
custom forms, manage event registrations and waivers, check-ins, deliver
notifications, and build analytics dashboards.

\subsection{System Boundaries}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{In Scope}: Administrator and student web and mobile interfaces, 
    form builder and renderer, registration and waiver processing, check-in and QR verification, 
    attendee overview dashboard, analytics and reporting, notifications, authentication and authorization, 
    and internal data storage.
    
    \item \textbf{Not Covered}: Third-party services like university single sign-on (SSO), 
    third-party email/SMS portals, and payment sites. These are treated as outside dependencies, 
    with interactions regulated through integration adapters.
    
    \item \textbf{Environment}: The system is web-based, compatible with major browsers, 
    and supports portable devices (iOS and Android). Its operation requires steady internet connectivity, 
    although it offers minimal offline capability for the check-in process.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Component Overview}

The system can be divided into the following major components for hazard analysis:

\subsubsection{Admin Web Application}
Provides administrators with tools to build forms, configure events, manage attendees, and view analytics.

\subsubsection{End-User Application (Web/Mobile)}
Interface for students to register for events and submit feedback surveys.

\subsubsection{Custom Form Builder and Renderer}
Schema-based system to define and display registration and feedback forms, including branching and conditional logic.

\subsubsection{Registration Form Manager}
Handles the creation and processing of registration forms, ensuring that event-specific data is collected accurately.

\subsubsection{Attendee Overview Dashboard}
Provides administrators with a consolidated view of registrations and attendee details for an event.

\subsubsection{Analytics and Reporting}
Generates data visualizations and exportable reports based on registration and survey responses, enabling event planning and improvement.

\subsubsection{Data Storage Layer}
Stores form schemas, form responses, and attendee information using structured databases and JSON-based storage.

\subsubsection{External Integration Adapters}
Interfaces with required external systems such as university single sign-on (SSO) and email services to support core functionality.




\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)}

The following section provides a breakdown of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for the system. Each component is evaluated for potential failures, their impact on system operation, possible causes, methods of detection, and recommended actions. This analysis ensures that hazards affecting event registration, form processing, check-ins, and analytics are identified early and mitigated through targeted safety and reliability requirements.

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
