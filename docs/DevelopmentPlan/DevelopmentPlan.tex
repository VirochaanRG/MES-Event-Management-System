\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/courses/capstone/-/blob/main/Lectures/L02b_POCAndDevPlan/POCAndDevPlan.pdf?ref_type=heads}
{lecture slides}.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

% \wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Issues: GitHub
  \item Meetings: MS Teams, Discord
  \item Meetings (with advisor): MS Teams
  \item Project Discussion: Discord
\end{itemize}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
% 	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
% 	classification, etc.?
%   \item Use of CI/CD
% \end{itemize}
The repository will have two primary branches, one for development and of for documentation, responsible for technical development and software documentation respectively.
\\\\
The average workflow will be as follows: \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pull changes from primary branch depending on the task at hand
  \item Create an issue for the assigned task if one does not already exist
  \item Create a new branch with the naming convention of: [assigned task - name of contributor]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If it is a new task, create a branch direcly under the primary
    \item If it is a follow up/subtask, create a sub-working branch branch from previous branch
  \end{itemize}
  \item Commit changes with detailed message
  \item Create unit tests for changes
  \item Open a pull request to the primary branch
  \item Link issue to pull request
  \item Wait for approval from other members and for testing to pass
  \item Merge pull request
\end{itemize}

Issues will be managed through GitHub Issues. Through GitHub Project boards, issues will be linked to notable meetings and milestones, and classified into categories: Meetings, To Do, In Progress, and Done. Each issue will be assigned to the relevant team members, who can provide feedback, report errors, and organize tasks. Issues will be tagged with distinct labels to indicate their priority, timeline, and type (e.g., bug, feature, documentation).
\\


\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
%   \item Include a link to your GitHub project
% \end{itemize}

% \wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
% details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
% for deadlines.}

The project is hosted on GitHub at the following link: \url{}
\\
A Kanban Board project setup is currently being used to track the progress of the project. The board is divided into four columns: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, and Done. Each task is represented as a card that can be moved across the columns as it progresses through different stages of completion. This visual representation allows team members to easily see the status of each task and identify any bottlenecks in the workflow.
\\
The cards can pertain to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lectures
  \item Group and Supervisor Meetings
  \item Project Milestones
\end{itemize}

The project is scheduled to be completed over the course of two semesters. However, we aim to have a working prototype by January to be tested across various events, including the Fireball Formal, and CALE Conference.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
\end{enumerate}

{University of Portland Team Charter}}

\subsection*{External Goals}

\wss{What are your team's external goals for this project? These are not the
goals related to the functionality or quality fo the project.  These are the
goals on what the team wishes to achieve with the project.  Potential goals are
to win a prize at the Capstone EXPO, or to have something to talk about in
interviews, or to get an A+, etc.}

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding meeting attendance (being on
time, leaving early, missing meetings, etc.)?}

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

\wss{What constitutes an acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or a deadline?
What types of excuses will not be considered acceptable?}

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

\wss{What process will team members follow if they have an emergency and cannot
attend a team meeting or complete their individual work promised for a team
deliverable?}

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

someone not contributing their fair share?}

\wss{You may wish to use the project management metrics collected for the TA and
instructor for this.}

\wss{You can set target metrics for attendance, commits, etc.  What are the
consequences if someone doesn't hit their targets?  Do they need to bring the
coffee to the next team meeting?  Does the team need to make an appointment with
their TA, or the instructor?  Are there incentives for reaching targets early?}
