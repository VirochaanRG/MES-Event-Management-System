This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the Rev 0
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the PoC demo and the Rev
0 demo; the contributions prior to the PoC are NOT included.

\section{Demo Plans}
For the Rev0 Demo we plan on having a full implementation of the MES Event and Survey Management Platform. This means that we intend to showcase all the features that we specified within the SRS to have a fully-implemented platform with both a web application and a mobile app. \\
\\
The web application will have two main components that we will showcase; the web user portal and the web admin portal. Within the web user portal we will showcase signing up for events and answering surveys. In the web admin portal we will showcase user authorization through role-based access controls, event management, form creation and management and the built in data analytics and data exporting features. In the mobile application we will showcase the same features as the user-side emphasizing the notifications for access. We will also show simplified event attendance through built in qr code tickets.
