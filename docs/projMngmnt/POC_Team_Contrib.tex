\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member up to the POC
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the beginning of the term
and the POC demo.

\section{Demo Plans}

For the POC demo, we will be spending a week completing the design documentation, and the remaining week before the deadline working on a codebase for the proof of concept. The goal for the proof of concept is to create a barebones system that highlights the main functionalities required by the system at the simplest level. By the presentation date and time, the team should have a system complete enough to present a demonstration of at least one business use case from end to end as defined in the SRS document.
\\
\\ This will be achieved by building a simple web application that allows the user to create a form with very basic customization options such as creating questions and setting the form name. The created form should be sent to a backend for storage in a database and its details should be retreived by a mobile application. The mobile application should be able to display the forms contents to the user and allow them to fill it out and submit the responses back to the backend. Finally, the web application should retreive the submitted responses for the form and display some basic statistics about the data such as submission counts and question response distribution.

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\noindent \textbf{Supervisor's Name: } Luke Schuurman

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 2\\
Ibrahim Quraishi & 2\\
Virochaan Ravichandran Gowri & 2\\

\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 8\\
Ibrahim Quraishi & 7\\
Virochaan Ravichandran Gowri & 3\\
Mohammad Mahdi Mahboob & 3\\
Rayyan Suhail & 3\\
Omar Al-Asfar & 3\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This table includes all lectures attended from week 3 onwards when the team was formed. Ibrahim attended more lectures as it was later agreed by the team to have one person attend and relay information to save time.

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

\noindent \textbf{TA's Name: } Tiago de Moraes Machado 

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 3\\
Ibrahim Quraishi & 3\\
Virochaan Ravichandran Gowri & 3\\
Mohammad Mahdi Mahboob & 3\\
Rayyan Suhail & 3\\
Omar Al-Asfar & 3\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Commits}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & 264 & 100\% \\
Ibrahim Quraishi & 40 & 15.2\% \\
Virochaan Ravichandran Gowri & 93 & 35.2\% \\
Rayyan Suhail & 45 & 17.0\% \\
Mohammad Mahdi Mahboob & 51 & 19.3\% \\
Omar Al-Asfar & 35 & 13.3\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The contribution percentage for Virochaan is much higher due to them handling most of the branch merging and conflict fixing when resolving pull requests, as well as differences in commit sizes.

\section{Issue Tracker}

\wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
issues (C only)) over the time period of interest.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Name 1 & Num & Num \\
Name 2 & Num & Num \\
Name 3 & Num & Num \\
Name 4 & Num & Num \\
Name 5 & Num & Num \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\section{CICD}

The main use of CI/CD for the duration of the project will be for regression testing. 
Every created unit test that has been verified to be correct will be added to the pipeline to ensure the correctness of the system remains the same between changes.
Additionally, the CI/CD will be used to enforce the AirBNB Javascript and JSX styling guides, as outlined in the development plan.

\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}

\wss{Provide a summary of the quantified triggers identified in the team's
charter.}

\wss{Provide a list of any violations of the triggers.  If the team wishes, the
violations can be summarized on aggregate, instead of naming specific team
members.}

\wss{Provide a plan to address the violations.  This could include revising the
triggers, if they are found to be too weak, strong or ambiguous.}

\section{Additional Productivity Metrics}

\wss{If your team has additional metrics of productivity, please feel free to
add them to this report.}
