\subsection{Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{Client}
The client for this project is the supervisor, Luke Schuurman. He is a member of the MES and has first hand experience plannig and hosting events with the MES. As the supervisor he will play a crucial role by ensuring the project aligns with objective of the MES and integrate the platform seamlessly with existing systems. He will also provide us with feedback and guidance throughout the project and will help define the project requirements in this document.

\subsubsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
\textbf{MES Executives and Council Members}: They will be utilizing this system to create and manage events, configure forms and surveys, monitor event data and generate data analytics reports. They can be characterized as primarily undergraduate students who value their time greatly. They aim to reduce the time taken to do administrative tasks as well as provide a better experience during MES events. Their experience with systems like this can range from Journeyman - Master as they can be experienced in event planning and student engagement. There may be a slight learning curve to utilizing the new technology but these users have experience performing these functions.\\
\newline
\textbf{McMaster Engineering Students}: They will be utilizing this app to to register for events, purchase tickets, sign waivers, check in at venues, and complete feedback surveys. They want to enjoy their university experience and connect with other students, They are also very busy and value their time greatly so are looking for an intuitive and straightforward user experience. Their general experience with systems like this is Journeyman as they may have used similar systems for other use cases. \\
\newline
\textbf{Other Students and Event Attendees}: This group includes non-engineering students, alumni, and invited guests who participate in large-scale MES events such as the Fireball Formal and Graduation Formal, which extend beyond the core engineering community. They are generally looking for an easy and seamless experience registering and attending these events. Their general experience with systems like this is Journeyman as they may have used similar systems for other use cases.
\subsubsection{Personas}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Matthew Cruise (Engineering Student): is a 20-year-old second-year Mechanical Engineering student who lives in a shared house near campus with two close friends. She enjoys attending MES events like pub nights and the Fireball Formal as a way to balance her heavy academic workload.
