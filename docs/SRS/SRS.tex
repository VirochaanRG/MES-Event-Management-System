\subsection{Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{Client}
The client for this project is the supervisor, Luke Schuurman. He is a member of the MES and has first hand experience plannig and hosting events with the MES. As the supervisor he will play a crucial role by ensuring the project aligns with objective of the MES and integrate the platform seamlessly with existing systems. He will also provide us with feedback and guidance throughout the project and will help define the project requirements in this document.

\subsubsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
\textbf{MES Executives and Council Members}: They will be utilizing this system to create and manage events, configure forms and surveys, monitor event data and generate data analytics reports. They can be characterized as primarily undergraduate students who value their time greatly. They aim to reduce the time taken to do administrative tasks as well as provide a better experience during MES events. Their experience with systems like this can range from Journeyman - Master as they can be experienced in event planning and student engagement. There may be a slight learning curve to utilizing the new technology but these users have experience performing these functions.\\
\newline
\textbf{McMaster Engineering Students}: They will be utilizing this app to to register for events, purchase tickets, sign waivers, check in at venues, and complete feedback surveys. They want to enjoy their university experience and connect with other students, They are also very busy and value their time greatly so are looking for an intuitive and straightforward user experience. Their general experience with systems like this is Journeyman as they may have used similar systems for other use cases. \\
\newline
\textbf{Other Students and Guest Event Attendees}: This group includes non-engineering students, alumni, and invited guests who participate in large-scale MES events such as the Fireball Formal and Graduation Formal, which extend beyond the core engineering community. It could also include students and guests from other universities as well as industry which attend the engineering conferences that the MES helps host. They are generally looking for an easy and seamless experience registering and attending these events. Their general experience with systems like this is Journeyman as they may have used similar systems for other use cases.
\subsubsection{Personas}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Matthew Cruise (Engineering Student)}: Matthew is a 20-year-old second-year Mechanical Engineering student at McMaster University.Hewho lives in a shared house near campus with two close friends. He enjoys attending MES events like pub nights and the Fireball Formal as a way to balance his heavy academic workload with some enjoyment and entertainment. He usually hears about events through word-of-mouth or social media and would prefer an easy and effortless way to find and register for events. Matthew is generally tech savvy and is comfortable using online platforms but doesn't want to be bothered by too many notifications and forms. He has many ideas on how he can generally improve his university experience but doesn't believe he has an outlet to convey them. For Matthew his priority is convenience as he wants to enjoy himself but doesn't want to spend too much time or effort doing so.
  \item \textbf{Adam Clooney (MES Executive)}: Adam Clooney is a 22-year-old final-year Civil Engineering student who currently serves as VP Social on the MES. He is responsible for coordinating large-scale events like Fireball Formal, working closely with other council members to handle logistics, advertising, and student engagement. Adam is outgoing and enjoys bringing people together, but often feels the strain of balancing his role with academic responsibilities. He is proficient with common digital tools such as Google Drive, spreadsheets, and design platforms for promotions, but he’s not highly technical. Adam appreciates structure and tools that keep things organized because he dislikes wasting time fixing errors or repeating work. He is motivated by the sense of accomplishment that comes from hosting a successful event and wants tools that help him stay on top of details.
  \item \textbf{Margot Watson (McMaster Student)}: Margot Watson is a 21-year-old undergraduate student in Political Science at McMaster University. Although she is not part of the engineering faculty, she often attends large MES-hosted events such as the Fireball Formal and other socials because many of her friends are in engineering. Margot lives in an off-campus apartment with two roommates and enjoys being involved in student life across faculties. She has a relaxed attitude toward technology since she uses her phone daily for social media and messaging but she prefers things to be straightforward and intuitive. She is cautious with her money, balancing tuition and living expenses, but she’s willing to spend on experiences with friends. She is motivated by spending time with her friends and having good experiences to have a fullfiling student life.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
\textbf{Key Users:} Luke Schuurman, MES Council Members and Executives, McMaster Engineering Students. \\
\textbf{Secondary Users:} Other Students and Guest Event Attendees.
\subsubsection{User Participation}
Our requirements will primarily be derived through meetings with our supervisor Luke Schuurman. If we have the need to clarify or elicit more requirements we will look to engage other MES members either through our supervisor or directly.
\subsubsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
\textit{The future maintenance and servicing of this project are beyond the scope of this capstone.}
