\section{Purpose of the Project}

The purpose of this project is to create a centralized platform for the McMaster Engineering Society (MES) that simplifies how large-scale events are managed. By consolidating event registration, form creation, attendee tracking, and data analytics into a single system, the platform aims to reduce administrative workload, eliminate fragmented workflows, and enhance the overall experience for both event organizers and attendees.

\subsection{User Business}

The primary users of this system are members of the McMaster Engineering Society, including executives and event organizers, as well as McMaster engineering students who attend MES events.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Administrators (MES Executives and Organizers):} Responsible for creating events, designing registration and feedback forms, managing attendee information, and analyzing data through the dashboard. They will use the platform to reduce manual work and improve event coordination.
    \item \textbf{End Users (Students and Attendees):} Students will use the platform to register for events, complete waivers or feedback forms, and receive event confirmations and updates. The goal is to create a seamless and engaging experience that encourages participation.
\end{itemize}

By serving both groups through a single platform, the system eliminates redundant workflows and ensures continuity of data across multiple events.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Develop a Custom Form Builder:} Build an intuitive tool that lets administrators design and manage event or feedback forms with different question types and conditional logic, without needing third-party software.
    \item \textbf{Implement a Unified Registration and Feedback System:} Create a simple, centralized process for students to register for events, complete waivers, and share feedback—all in one place.
    \item \textbf{Create an Attendee Overview Dashboard:} Give administrators a clear view of event participation by displaying key details such as registration status, payments, and waiver completion in real time.
    \item \textbf{Integrate Backend Analytics:} Include tools that help MES organizers analyze event data, track trends, and use insights to plan and improve future events more effectively.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Personas}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Matthew Cruise (Engineering Student)}: Matthew is a 20-year-old second-year Mechanical Engineering student at McMaster University. He lives in a shared house near campus with two close friends. He enjoys attending MES events like pub nights and the Fireball Formal as a way to balance his heavy academic workload with some enjoyment and entertainment. He usually hears about events through word-of-mouth or social media and would prefer an easy and effortless way to find and register for events. Matthew is generally tech savvy and is comfortable using online platforms but doesn't want to be bothered by too many notifications and forms. He has many ideas on how he can generally improve his university experience but doesn't believe he has an outlet to convey them. For Matthew his priority is convenience as he wants to enjoy himself but doesn't want to spend too much time or effort doing so.
  \item \textbf{Adam Clooney (MES Executive)}: Adam Clooney is a 22-year-old final-year Civil Engineering student who currently serves as VP Social on the MES. He is responsible for coordinating large-scale events like Fireball Formal, working closely with other council members to handle logistics, advertising, and student engagement. Adam is outgoing and enjoys bringing people together, but often feels the strain of balancing his role with academic responsibilities. He is proficient with common digital tools such as Google Drive, spreadsheets, and design platforms for promotions, but he’s not highly technical. Adam appreciates structure and tools that keep things organized because he dislikes wasting time fixing errors or repeating work. He is motivated by the sense of accomplishment that comes from hosting a successful event and wants tools that help him stay on top of details.
  \item \textbf{Margot Watson (McMaster Student)}: Margot Watson is a 21-year-old undergraduate student in Political Science at McMaster University.

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}

\subsection{Relevant Facts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The McMaster Engineering Society (MES) currently manages events such as Fireball Formal and the CALE Conference using several disconnected tools like Google Forms and Google Sheets, which creates inefficiencies and limits data analysis.
    \item Each MES event involves registration, waiver collection, and feedback surveys that must comply with university data privacy and accessibility standards.
    \item The system will be used by both administrators and students on a wide range of devices and browsers, so responsive and cross-platform design is required.
    \item The overall Event Management System is being co-developed by three Capstone teams. Project A must maintain compatibility and shared data models with the other two teams’ components.
    \item The project’s frontend stack was recently updated from \textbf{Next.js} to \textbf{Vite + TanStack Router + TanStack Create} to improve development speed, hot reloading performance, and flexibility for building a Single Page Application (SPA) with integrated admin dashboards and authentication.
    \item PostgreSQL remains the chosen database technology for data storage and analytics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Business Rules}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Only verified MES administrators can create, edit, or delete forms and view backend analytics.
    \item Event data, form responses, and attendee details must be securely stored and retrievable for future event reviews.
    \item All user input will be validated to prevent incomplete or invalid submissions before being stored in the database.
    \item A consistent data format must be maintained across all events to support accurate analytics and report generation.
    \item Administrators can export data such as attendee lists or analytics summaries in standard formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The MES will provide sample event and registration data to support development and testing.
    \item Users will have stable internet access when using the platform, as it relies on real-time connectivity.
    \item Collaborating teams (Projects B and C) will follow the agreed API and database specifications to ensure system integration works smoothly.
    \item Authentication and authorization will be handled securely within the shared platform using standardized methods.
    \item Future MES administrators and developers will continue maintaining the project using the provided GitHub repository, documentation, and CI/CD workflows.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Scope of the Work}

The purpose of the section is to define the expected scope of the project, including specifications on how the system is partitioned, business data models, and business use cases.

\subsection{The Current Situation}

Currently, the \Gls{mes} uses a plethora of different platforms to host events and conduct surveys such as tools for registration, signing of waivers, and checking in attendees. The main platforms used are a combination of Google Forms and Google Sheets. There are several pain points to address with the current system.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Decentralized System Components} Registration and surverying is split across a plethora of tools and software which may not be compatible with each other. For example, Google Forms is used for registration forms and surveys, Google Sheets stores form data and LinkTree holds links to all the registration forms, and event updates is done by email or social media.
  \item \textbf{Overly Complex Form Logic} The current \Gls{cfes} survey consists of 70 pages of questions linked together through complex branching logic. The Google Forms form building UI makes this very complicated as all form elements are displayed as a linear list of sections making it very hard to track paths through the form.
  \item \textbf{Disorganized Data Visualization} Form response data is currently stored using Google Sheets. While Google Form data is easily imported into Google Sheets, any analytics on the data must be done manually through equations and macros.
  \item \textbf{Lack of Reusability} Google Forms comes with a few templates that provide an initial starting point for many types of forms such as registrant information. However, after the first section of the form, each subsequent section must be made manually. Sections may be imported from other forms but this requires the user to have access to a form with the wanted section and to scour through an unorganized list of forms and sections.
  \item \textbf{Low Response Rates on Surveys} The response rates on the annual \Gls{cfes} survey of undergraduate engineering students have been decreasing due to the long length of the Google Form and the lack of ability to submit a partially completed form.
  \item \textbf{Manual Registration Scheduling} Event registration is managed through a combination of Instragram, Google Forms, and LinkTree. Events are advertised on Instagram, and a link to the signup Google Form is posted on the MES LinkTree. This solution lacks automation since a new Google Form must be made for every event and links have to be manually added and removed for each form when registration is opened or closed.
\end{itemize}

% \gls{mes} hosts lots of events per year
% Their event management system is unorganized
% Consists of google forms, google sheets
% No template form to work with redundant info between forms like name, number email, etc
% Lots of steps to registration and split across too many platforms
% The same thing is done for the annual CFES survey of undergrad eng students
% long 70 page form of complex branching logic, low response rate

\subsection{The Context of the Work}

This section provides an overview of the high-level inputs and outputs between the system and external systems or actors.
The system is split into two perspectives, the \gls{atd} perspective shown in \hyperref[fig:workcontextuser]{Figure \ref{fig:workcontextuser}}, and the \gls{adm} perspective shown in \hyperref[fig:workcontextadmin]{Figure \ref{fig:workcontextadmin}}.

% Any problems that remain unresolved and undefined
\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}
There are some products that exists on the market which solve certain components of this product but no product exists that combines these components into one. For event management there are various tools such as EventBrite and Stubhub which can allow for the selling of tickets for events. The problem with these products are that they don't integrate well with current MES Systems and don't provide all the features as required such as collecting waivers and ensuring McMaster students attend university specific events. For general data collection Google Forms is the most used tool and it allows for the creation of complex forms and stores data in spreadsheets. For further data analysis it requires effort on the part of the form creator to actually go and analyze the data to gain actual insights. Also the forms can become hard to handle as they become complex and can become confusing for respondents. As mentioned before there is no tool that has a combination of the two components.
\subsection{Reusable Components}
There are various components that we can use to help develop our application:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Vite}: Provides us with a framework for developing web apps in \textbf{React} and provides built in routing behaviour. It also handles many built in libraries and packages that we can use for front-end styling such as \textbf{tailwind-css}. We can also integrate it with other libraries for authentication and for database management
  \item \textbf{TanStack}: Provides us with a powerfull middleware to connect backend and front-end services. Will primarily be used for routing but also offers data visualization capabilities. Offers many libraries for working with data and state management that we can leverage.
  \item \textbf{SurveyJS}: This is a potential tool we can use to develop the form builder as it provides us with some pre-built components we can use to develop and customize our own forms. 
  \item \textbf{Recharts}: This could be potential charting tool we can use to develop our admin dashboard. Though there are other charting tools the benefit of Recharts is that it provides customization on top of the pre built charts.
  \item \textbf{Drizzle}: We can use Drizzle as an ORM to map from our database to our web-app. Drizzle is useful since it is lightweight and is code first. Drizzle's simplicity allows for faster development and is perfect for our use case.
\end{itemize}
These components will allow us to develop our application faster and more efficiently as many of these products are already optimized. All the above products are free to use so do not incur any extra costs or require the handling of licenses.
\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
\textit{There don't seem to be any products that can be copied which contain all the required components within a single product. Moreover the MES wants a product that doesn't require an external license and wants to be fully built in house so they have control over future development and usage.}

\section{Tasks}
\subsection{Project Planning}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Task Assignment:} Tasks are divided based on each member’s technical strengths and defined roles.  
    Rayyan leads the admin web UI, Virochaan handles full-stack web and DevOps, Ibrahim focuses on backend and mobile integration, Omar develops mobile UI components, and Mahdi manages backend logic and database design.
    \item \textbf{Collaboration:} Weekly meetings are held to review progress, plan upcoming work, and prepare for supervisor syncs.  
    Daily communication occurs over Discord, while GitHub Issues serve as the main hub for technical updates.
    \item \textbf{Quality Control:} All new code must pass automated linting and testing via GitHub Actions before merging.  
    Peer reviews on pull requests ensure consistency and prevent regressions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Planning of Development Phases}

Development is organized into five phases, each with clear goals and deliverables.  
The primary objective is to have a fully functional \textbf{Minimum Viable Product (MVP)} by the end of \textbf{December 2025}, where all four core features work at a basic level before refinement begins.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1 – Requirements and Design (September–October 2025)}  
    Finalize system requirements, architecture, and UI mockups for the Admin Portal and Custom Form Builder.  
    Deliverables include the SRS, Hazard Analysis, and shared API specifications with Projects B and C.
    
    \item \textbf{Phase 2 – Core Functionality and MVP (Mid October–December 2025)}  
    Implement the main system features for a working MVP:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Basic \textbf{Custom Form Builder} for creating and saving modular forms.  
        \item Functional \textbf{Registration and Feedback Forms} linked to the backend.  
        \item Simple \textbf{Attendee Overview Dashboard} showing registration data.  
        \item Initial \textbf{Backend Analytics} for event and submission counts.
    \end{itemize}
    The MVP will demonstrate a complete flow—from form creation to submission and viewing results.
    
    \item \textbf{Phase 3 – Integration and Refinement (January 2026)}  
    Improve performance, UI/UX, and backend data handling.  
    Begin integration testing with Projects B and C to ensure smooth database and API interaction.
    
    \item \textbf{Phase 4 – Analytics and Dashboard Expansion (February–March 2026)}  
    Enhance analytics and administrative tools with filtering, charts, and export options (CSV/PDF).  
    The dashboard will evolve into a production-ready tool for MES event organizers.
    
    \item \textbf{Phase 5 – Testing and Deployment (March–April 2026)}  
    Conduct final testing, bug fixes, and documentation updates.  
    Complete cross-team integration and deploy the system for real MES events such as Fireball Formal or CALE Conference.  
    Prepare final deliverables and the Capstone Expo presentation.

\section{Costs}
We don't expect any costs to arise during the development of the project. We will be using free tools and libraries for development and for hosting we will look to host databases and the back-end locally. In production the hosting will be done by the MES so it is out of the scope of this capstone.
