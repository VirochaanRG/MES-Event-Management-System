\section{The Scope of the Work}

The purpose of the section is to define the expected scope of the project, including specifications on how the system is partitioned, business data models, and business use cases.

\subsection{The Current Situation}

Currently, the MES uses plethora of different platforms to host events and conduct surveys such as tools for registration, signing of waivers, and checking in attendees. The main platforms used are a combination of Google Forms and Google Sheets. There are several pain points to address with the current system.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Decentralized System Components} Registration and surverying is split across a plethora of tools and software which may not be compatible with each other. For example, Google Forms is used for registration forms and surveys, Google Sheets stores form data and LinkTree holds links to all the registration forms, and event updates is done by email or social media. 
  \item \textbf{Overly Complex Form Logic} The current CFES survey consists of 70 pages of questions linked together through complex branching logic. The Google Forms form building UI makes this very complicated as all form elements are displayed as a linear list of sections making it very hard to track paths through the form.
  \item \textbf{Disorganized Data Visualization} Form response data is currently stored using Google Sheets. While Google Form data is easily imported into Google Sheets, any analytics on the data must be done manually through equations and macros.
  \item \textbf{Lack of Reusability} Google Forms comes with a few templates that provide an initial starting point for many types of forms such as registrant information. However, after the first section of the form, each subsequent section must be made manually. Sections may be imported from other forms but this requires the user to have access to a form with the wanted section and to scour through an unorganized list of forms and sections.
  \item \textbf{Low Response Rates on Surveys} The response rates on the annual CFES survey of undergraduate engineering students have been decreasing due to the long length of the Google Form and the lack of ability to submit a partially completed form.
  \item \textbf{Manual Registration Scheduling} Event registration is managed through a combination of Instragram, Google Forms, and LinkTree. Events are advertised on Instagram, and a link to the signup Google Form is posted on the MES LinkTree. This solution lacks automation since a new Google Form must be made for every event and links have to be manually added and removed for each form when registration is opened or closed. 
\end{itemize}
% MES hosts lots of events per year
% Their event management system is unorganized
% Consists of google forms, google sheets
% No template form to work with redundant info between forms like name, number email, etc
% Lots of steps to registration and split across too many platforms
% The same thing is done for the annual CFES survey of undergrad eng students
% long 70 page form of complex branching logic, low response rate

\subsection{The Context of the Work}

This section provides an overview of the high-level inputs and outputs between the system and external systems or actors. Figure X illustrates a work context diagram showing the interactions between the system components and external elements.

% provide a use case for each sub workflow
\section{Business Data Model and Data Dictionary}
\subsection{Business Data Model}
\lips
% Split the entire system into subsystems which the data passes through and the form it takes at each step 
% This is NOT the same as workflow partition. This deals with DATA and the other deals with PROCESSES
\subsection{Data Dictionary}
\lips
% Definition of each subsystem defined above
\section{The Scope of the Product}
\subsection{Product Boundary}
\lips
% Produce a Product Boundary Diagram which shows what happens inside of the system and how it happens, and what comes from/goes outside the system
\subsection{Product Use Case Table}
\lips
% Label each product use case from the diagram and map them to actors, inputs/outputs, and requirement numbers
\subsection{Individual Product Use Cases (PUC's)}
\lips
% Take each Product user case and define it further with the following
% Trigger - what caused this use case to execute
% Actors - what actors caused the trigger
% Preconditions - what properties hold before the use case occurs
% Input - input to the use case
% output - output of the use case
% outcome - What happened as a result of the use case
