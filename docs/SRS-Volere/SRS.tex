\section{Purpose of the Project}

The purpose of this project is to create a centralized platform for the \gls{mes} that simplifies how large-scale events
are managed. By consolidating event registration, form creation, attendee tracking, and data analytics into a single
system, the platform aims to reduce administrative workload, eliminate fragmented workflows, and enhance the overall
experience for both event organizers and attendees.

\subsection{User Business}

The primary users of this system are members of the McMaster Engineering Society, including executives and event
organizers, as well as McMaster engineering students who attend \gls{mes} events.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Administrators (\gls{mes} Executives and Organizers):} Responsible for creating events, designing
      registration and feedback forms, managing attendee information, and analyzing data through the dashboard. They
      will use the platform to reduce manual work and improve event coordination.
    \item \textbf{End Users (Students and Attendees):} Students will use the platform to register for events, complete
      waivers or feedback forms, and receive event confirmations and updates. The goal is to create a seamless and
      engaging experience that encourages participation.
\end{itemize}

By serving both groups through a single platform, the system eliminates redundant workflows and ensures continuity of
data across multiple events.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Develop a Custom Form Builder:} Build an intuitive tool that lets administrators design and manage
      event or feedback forms with different question types and conditional logic, without needing third-party software.
    \item \textbf{Implement a Unified Registration and Feedback System:} Create a simple, centralized process for
      students to register for events, complete waivers, and share feedback—all in one place.
    \item \textbf{Create an Attendee Overview Dashboard:} Give administrators a clear view of event participation by
      displaying key details such as registration status, payments, and waiver completion in real time.
    \item \textbf{Integrate Backend Analytics:} Include tools that help \gls{mes} organizers analyze event data, track
      trends, and use insights to plan and improve future events more effectively.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Stakeholders}

\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
\textbf{\gls{mes} Executives and Council Members}: They will be utilizing this system to create and manage events,
configure forms and surveys, monitor event data and generate data analytics reports. They can be characterized as
primarily undergraduate students who value their time greatly. They aim to reduce the time taken to do administrative
tasks as well as provide a better experience during \gls{mes} events. Their experience with systems like this can range
from Journeyman - Master as they can be experienced in event planning and student engagement. There may be a slight
learning curve to utilizing the new technology, but these users have experience performing these functions.\\
\newline
\textbf{McMaster Engineering Students}: They will be utilizing this app to register for events, purchase tickets, sign
waivers, check in at venues, and complete feedback surveys. They want to enjoy their university experience and connect
with other students, They are also very busy and value their time greatly so are looking for an intuitive and
straightforward user experience. Their general experience with systems like this is Journeyman as they may have used
similar systems for other use cases. \\
\newline
\textbf{Other Students and Guest Event Attendees}: This group includes non-engineering students, alumni, and invited
guests who participate in large-scale \gls{mes} events such as the Fireball Formal and Graduation Formal, which extend
beyond the core engineering community. It could also include students and guests from other universities as well as
industry which attend the engineering conferences that the \gls{mes} helps host. They are generally looking for an easy
and seamless experience registering and attending these events. Their general experience with systems like this is
Journeyman as they may have used similar systems for other use cases.
\subsection{Personas}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Matthew Cruise (Engineering Student)}: Matthew is a 20-year-old second-year Mechanical Engineering
    student at McMaster University. He lives in a shared house near campus with two close friends. He enjoys attending
    \gls{mes} events like pub nights and the Fireball Formal as a way to balance his heavy academic workload with some
    enjoyment and entertainment. He usually hears about events through word-of-mouth or social media and would prefer an
    easy and effortless way to find and register for events. Matthew is generally tech-savvy and is comfortable using
    online platforms but doesn't want to be bothered by too many notifications and forms. He has many ideas on how he
    can generally improve his university experience but doesn't believe he has an outlet to convey them. For Matthew his
    priority is convenience as he wants to enjoy himself but doesn't want to spend too much time or effort doing so.
  \item \textbf{Adam Clooney (\gls{mes} Executive)}: Adam Clooney is a 22-year-old final-year Civil Engineering student
    who currently serves as VP Social on the \gls{mes}. He is responsible for coordinating large-scale events like
    Fireball Formal, working closely with other council members to handle logistics, advertising, and student
    engagement. Adam is outgoing and enjoys bringing people together, but often feels the strain of balancing his role
    with academic responsibilities. He is proficient with common digital tools such as Google Drive, spreadsheets, and
    design platforms for promotions, but he’s not highly technical. Adam appreciates structure and tools that keep
    things organized because he dislikes wasting time fixing errors or repeating work. He is motivated by the sense of
    accomplishment that comes from hosting a successful event and wants tools that help him stay on top of details.
  \item \textbf{Margot Watson (McMaster Student)}: Margot Watson is a 21-year-old undergraduate student in Political
    Science at McMaster University. Although she is not part of the engineering faculty, she often attends large

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}

\subsection{Relevant Facts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The McMaster Engineering Society currently manages events such as Fireball Formal and the CALE Conference
      using several disconnected tools like Google Forms and Google Sheets, which creates inefficiencies and limits data
      analysis.
    \item Each \gls{mes} event involves registration, waiver collection, and feedback surveys that must comply with
      university data privacy and accessibility standards.
    \item The system will be used by both administrators and students on a wide range of devices and browsers, so
      responsive and cross-platform design is required.
    \item The overall Event Management System is being co-developed by three Capstone teams. Project A must maintain
      compatibility and shared data models with the other two teams’ components.
    \item The project’s frontend stack was recently updated from \textbf{Next.js} to \textbf{Vite + TanStack Router +
      TanStack Create} to improve development speed, hot reloading performance, and flexibility for building a Single
      Page Application (SPA) with integrated admin dashboards and authentication.
    \item PostgreSQL remains the chosen database technology for data storage and analytics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Business Rules}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Only verified \gls{mes} administrators can create, edit, or delete forms and view backend analytics.
    \item Event data, form responses, and attendee details must be securely stored and retrievable for future event
      reviews.
    \item All user input will be validated to prevent incomplete or invalid submissions before being stored in the
      database.
    \item A consistent data format must be maintained across all events to support accurate analytics and report
      generation.
    \item Administrators can export data such as attendee lists or analytics summaries in standard formats (e.g., CSV,
      PDF).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \gls{mes} will provide sample event and registration data to support development and testing.
    \item Users will have stable internet access when using the platform, as it relies on real-time connectivity.
    \item Collaborating teams (Projects B and C) will follow the agreed API and database specifications to ensure system
      integration works smoothly.
    \item Authentication and authorization will be handled securely within the shared platform using standardized
      methods.
    \item Future \gls{mes} administrators and developers will continue maintaining the project using the provided GitHub
      repository, documentation, and CI/CD workflows.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Scope of the Work}

The purpose of the section is to define the expected scope of the project, including specifications on how the system is
partitioned, business data models, and business use cases.

\subsection{The Current Situation}

Currently, the \gls{mes} uses plethora of different platforms to host events and conduct surveys such as tools for
registration, signing of waivers, and checking in \glspl{atd}. The main platforms used are a combination of Google Forms
and Google Sheets. There are several pain points to address with the current system.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Decentralized System Components} Registration and surveying is split across a plethora of tools and
    software which may not be compatible with each other. For example, Google Forms is used for registration forms and
    surveys, Google Sheets stores form data and LinkTree holds links to all the registration forms, and event updates is
    done by email or social media.
  \item \textbf{Overly Complex Form Logic} The current \gls{cfes} survey consists of 70 pages of questions linked
    together through complex branching logic. The Google Forms form building UI makes this very complicated as all form
    elements are displayed as a linear list of sections making it very hard to track paths through the form.
  \item \textbf{Disorganized Data Visualization} Form response data is currently stored using Google Sheets. While
    Google Form data is easily imported into Google Sheets, any analytics on the data must be done manually through
    equations and macros.
  \item \textbf{Lack of Reusability} Google Forms comes with a few templates that provide an initial starting point for
    many types of forms such as registrant information. However, after the first section of the form, each subsequent
    section must be made manually. Sections may be imported from other forms, but this requires the user to have access
    to a form with the wanted section and to scour through an unorganized list of forms and sections.
  \item \textbf{Low Response Rates on Surveys} The response rates on the annual \gls{cfes} survey of undergraduate engineering
    students have been decreasing due to the long length of the Google Form and the lack of ability to submit a
    partially completed form.
  \item \textbf{Manual Registration Scheduling} Event registration is managed through a combination of Instagram, Google
    Forms, and LinkTree. Events are advertised on Instagram, and a link to the signup Google Form is posted on the
    \gls{mes} LinkTree. This solution lacks automation since a new Google Form must be made for every event and links
    have to be manually added and removed for each form when registration is opened or closed.
\end{itemize}

% \gls{mes} hosts lots of events per year
% Their event management system is unorganized
% Consists of google forms, google sheets
% No template form to work with redundant info between forms like name, number email, etc
% Lots of steps to registration and split across too many platforms
% The same thing is done for the annual \gls{cfes} survey of undergrad eng students
% long 70 page form of complex branching logic, low response rate

\subsection{The Context of the Work}

This section provides an overview of the high-level inputs and outputs between the system and external systems or
actors.
The system is split into two perspectives, the \gls{atd} perspective shown in \hyperref[fig:workcontextuser]{Figure
\ref{fig:workcontextuser}}, and the \gls{adm} perspective shown in \hyperref[fig:workcontextadmin]{Figure
\ref{fig:workcontextadmin}}.

\subsection{Work Partitioning}

This section describes how the work done by the system can be partitioned into smaller and more manageable workflows.
Below is a table describing each of the sub-workflows of the proposed systems. Note that event creation and survey
creation have been grouped as a single workflow since they are nearly identical.

% Any problems that remain unresolved and undefined
\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}
There are some products that exist on the market which solve certain components of this product but no product exists
that combines these components into one. For event management there are various tools such as EventBrite and Stubhub
which can allow for the selling of tickets for events. The problem with these products are that they don't integrate
well with current \gls{mes} Systems and don't provide all the features as required such as collecting waivers and
ensuring McMaster students attend university specific events. For general data collection Google Forms is the most used
tool, and it allows for the creation of complex forms and stores data in spreadsheets. For further data analysis it
requires effort on the part of the form creator to actually go and analyze the data to gain actual insights. Also, the
forms can become hard to handle as they become complex and can become confusing for respondents. As mentioned before
there is no tool that has a combination of the two components.
\subsection{Reusable Components}
There are various components that we can use to help develop our application:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Vite}: Provides us with a framework for developing web apps in \textbf{React} and provides built in
    routing behaviour. It also handles many built in libraries and packages that we can use for front-end styling such
    as \textbf{tailwind-css}. We can also integrate it with other libraries for authentication and for database
    management
  \item \textbf{TanStack}: Provides us with a powerful middleware to connect backend and front-end services. Will
    primarily be used for routing but also offers data visualization capabilities. Offers many libraries for working
    with data and state management that we can leverage.
  \item \textbf{SurveyJS}: This is a potential tool we can use to develop the form builder as it provides us with some
    pre-built components we can use to develop and customize our own forms.
  \item \textbf{Recharts}: This could be potential charting tool we can use to develop our admin dashboard. Though there
    are other charting tools the benefit of Recharts is that it provides customization on top of the pre-built charts.
  \item \textbf{Drizzle}: We can use Drizzle as an ORM to map from our database to our web-app. Drizzle is useful since
    it is lightweight and is code first. Drizzle's simplicity allows for faster development and is perfect for our use
    case.
\end{itemize}
These components will allow us to develop our application faster and more efficiently as many of these products are
already optimized. All the above products are free to use so do not incur any extra costs or require the handling of
licenses.
\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
\textit{There don't seem to be any products that can be copied which contain all the required components within a single
product. Moreover, the \gls{mes} wants a product that doesn't require an external license and wants to be fully built in
house, so they have control over future development and usage.}

\section{Tasks}
\subsection{Project Planning }

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Task Assignment:} Tasks are divided based on each member’s technical strengths and defined roles.
    Rayyan leads the admin web UI, Virochaan handles full-stack web and DevOps, Ibrahim focuses on backend and mobile integration, Omar develops mobile UI components, and Mahdi manages backend logic and database design.
    \item \textbf{Collaboration:} Weekly meetings are held to review progress, plan upcoming work, and prepare for supervisor syncs.
    Daily communication occurs over Discord, while GitHub Issues serve as the main hub for technical updates.
    \item \textbf{Quality Control:} All new code must pass automated linting and testing via GitHub Actions before merging.
    Peer reviews on pull requests ensure consistency and prevent regressions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Planning of Development Phases}

Development is organized into five phases, each with clear goals and deliverables.
The primary objective is to have a fully functional \textbf{Minimum Viable Product (MVP)} by the end of \textbf{December 2025}, where all four core features work at a basic level before refinement begins.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1 – Requirements and Design (September–October 2025)}
    Finalize system requirements, architecture, and UI mockups for the Admin Portal and Custom Form Builder.
    Deliverables include the SRS, Hazard Analysis, and shared API specifications with Projects B and C.

    \item \textbf{Phase 2 – Core Functionality and MVP (Mid October–December 2025)}
    Implement the main system features for a working MVP:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Basic \textbf{Custom Form Builder} for creating and saving modular forms.
        \item Functional \textbf{Registration and Feedback Forms} linked to the backend.
        \item Simple \textbf{Attendee Overview Dashboard} showing registration data.
        \item Initial \textbf{Backend Analytics} for event and submission counts.
    \end{itemize}
    The MVP will demonstrate a complete flow—from form creation to submission and viewing results.

    \item \textbf{Phase 3 – Integration and Refinement (January 2026)}
    Improve performance, UI/UX, and backend data handling.
    Begin integration testing with Projects B and C to ensure smooth database and API interaction.

    \item \textbf{Phase 4 – Analytics and Dashboard Expansion (February–March 2026)}
    Enhance analytics and administrative tools with filtering, charts, and export options (CSV/PDF).
    The dashboard will evolve into a production-ready tool for MES event organizers.

    \item \textbf{Phase 5 – Testing and Deployment (March–April 2026)}
    Conduct final testing, bug fixes, and documentation updates.
    Complete cross-team integration and deploy the system for real MES events such as Fireball Formal or CALE Conference.
    Prepare final deliverables and the Capstone Expo presentation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
Migration to the new system will be straightforward as there is no existing framework in the first place. The MES currently uses a combination of Google Forms and other platforms to handle event registration and feedback collection. The new system will replace these manual processes with the new platform that centralizes and streamlines event management. The MES will simply transition to this system for future events, with no migration process required.
\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
Not Applicable.

\section{Costs}
We don't expect any costs to arise during the development of the project. We will be using free tools and libraries for
development and for hosting we will look to host databases and the back-end locally. In production the hosting will be
done by the \gls{mes}, so it is out of the scope of this Capstone.

\section{User Documentation and Training}

\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}

No separate written documentation or manuals are planned for this system.
Instead, all user guidance will be built directly into the application to create a more natural and seamless learning experience.
This approach ensures that both attendees and administrators can quickly understand how to use the platform without leaving the interface.

The system will include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Interactive Onboarding:}
    Step-by-step tutorial pop-ups and tooltips that appear during first-time use to introduce users to key features such as event registration, check-in, and analytics.

    \item \textbf{Guided Walkthroughs:}
    Contextual highlights that show users where to click and how to complete common actions directly within the interface.

    \item \textbf{Short Visual Aids:}
    Optional embedded videos or animations explaining how to perform important tasks, such as creating an event or submitting a form.
\end{itemize}

These interactive elements replace the need for formal documentation and are designed to make the system self-explanatory and easy to learn.
Users will be able to replay the onboarding sequence or revisit tips at any time from within the application.

\subsection{Training Requirements}

No formal training sessions or written instructions are required for this system.
The design prioritizes simplicity, discoverability, and self-learning through interactive guidance.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{End Users (Attendees):}
    Will learn the system through in-app pop-ups and short guided tutorials shown during their first login.
    These tutorials will walk users through tasks such as signing up for an event, filling out a form, or checking in.

    \item \textbf{Administrators and Event Organizers:}
    Will be guided through core management workflows using the same interactive approach, supported by optional short videos or animations that explain advanced features such as creating forms or viewing analytics.
\end{itemize}

Overall, training and documentation will be fully integrated into the user experience.
The application itself will serve as the guide, helping users learn by doing rather than reading external instructions.
